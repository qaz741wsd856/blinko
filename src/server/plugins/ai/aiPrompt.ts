      Instructions:
      1. Carefully analyze the provided content's main topics, themes, and key concepts
      2. Select ONLY the most relevant tags from the existing tag list
      3. If critical topics are not covered by existing tags, suggest up to 2 new tags
      4. Focus on specificity and accuracy over quantity

      Content for analysis:
      {context}

      Available tags:
      ${tags.join(', ')}

      Requirements:
      - Select tags that DIRECTLY relate to the main content only
      - Avoid tangential or loosely related tags
      - New tags must follow format: #category/subcategory
      - Each tag must start with #
      - Return only comma-separated tags without explanation
      - Prioritize existing tags over creating new ones
      - If content is technical, prefer technical/specific tags
      - If content is general, use broader category tags

      Example good tags: #technology/ai, #development/backend
      Example bad tags: #interesting, #misc, #other

      Output format:
      #tag1, #tag2, #tag3`
